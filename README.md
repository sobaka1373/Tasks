## Workflow
1. Create repository in your github account and add your mentor as collaborator.
2. Subscribe to your repository to be able to receive any notification on it.
3. Create separate branch and folder for each task.
4. When you are ready to show your solution, create PR.
5. Don't push to master/main branch without mentor's permission.
6. Before merging task branch to master/main branch, rebase your branch to single commit.
7. Use PSR standarts for code stylings, autoloading etc.
8. Use English for comments, class, properties, methods, functions and etc. names.
